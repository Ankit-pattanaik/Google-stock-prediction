# Google-stock-prediction
Introduction
Stock price prediction is a dynamic and challenging field within the realm of financial analysis that revolves around forecasting the future value of a company's stock based on historical data and various market indicators. This predictive analytics task is of paramount importance for investors, traders, and financial analysts, as it empowers them to make informed decisions, manage risks, and potentially capitalize on market opportunities.
To understand this i have built a project for stock price prediction using LSTM model and i have used the google stock data for model training and testing.

Project Overview
Objective
The project aims to use historical Google stock data to train an LSTM model for accurate future stock price predictions, employing deep learning to capture complex market patterns.

Data Source
Historical stock data from Google, including opening/closing prices, highs/lows, adjusted close prices, and trading volume, serves as the foundation for model training.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:-
.Load and explore the Google stock dataset.
.Focus on 'Close' prices for LSTM training.
.Scale data using MinMax scaling.
.Create sequences of data for model input features (X) and target variable (y).

LSTM Model Construction:-
Utilize LSTM architecture, known for capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. The model comprises two LSTM layers followed by Dense layers for predictions. Adam optimizer and mean squared error are used for training.

Training and Evaluation:-
.Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
.Train the model on the training set to learn underlying patterns.
.Evaluate model performance on the test set using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Predicting Future Stock Prices:-
Use the trained model to predict Google stock prices for the next 30 days. Make predictions on a sequence of data corresponding to the next 30 days and visualize the results.

Conclusion
This project showcases the effectiveness of LSTM networks in predicting stock prices using Google stock as a case study. The integration of deep learning and financial data analysis provides a potent tool for understanding and forecasting market trends.
